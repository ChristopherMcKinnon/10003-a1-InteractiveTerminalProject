# 10003-a1-InteractiveTerminalProject
An interactive terminal RPG scenario limited to just variables, operations, if/else statements, and console input/output (with the kind exception of "goto" to make it possible).

Hi! 
In this horror game you will need to collect a certain amount of evidence before you can leave, but be careful, as you are not alone.
Just pick the dialogue options you think are best, and try to find all 5 endings!
Make sure to run the game in fullscreen (f11) for the intended experience.
Try not to make a wrong input, as I wasn't allowed to really do much error handling.

There are some darker themes in this story, so beware (I already cut out some over-the-top content).
Email me at Christopher.Lawrick-McKinnon@mohawkcollege.ca if you find any bugs or issues!

============================
An aspect of this game that I really am proud of is the replayability of an adventure like this. The "bad" decision mechanic, and the evidence collecting mechanic combined allow for some interesting interactions, especially with the bedroom area. Since the bedroom forces you to take 2 bad decisions, one to get in and another to get out, its safe to say that going in with 3 bad decisions already taken beforehand makes for certain death no matter what. However, if the evidence within the bedroom is the last piece of evidence you need, it allows you to escape the bedroom freely, having freed the spirit. This wasn't scripted, but was a nice harmony with how the mechanics work with the game.
