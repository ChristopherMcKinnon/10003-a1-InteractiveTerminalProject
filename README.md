Hi! 
In this horror game you will need to collect a certain amount of evidence before you can leave, but be careful, as you are not alone.
Just pick the dialogue options you think are best, and try to find all 5 endings!


There are some darker themes in this story, so beware (I already cut out some over-the-top content).
Email me at Christopher.Lawrick-McKinnon@mohawkcollege.ca if you find any bugs!
